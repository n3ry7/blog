# Nery Neto

I am really fascinated by the open source software community and that
is what brought me to coding. During my graduation in Control and
Automation Engineering by UFRGS, I used a lot of FOSS and I realized
that I always seemed to find a good FOSS solution to the problems I
was trying to solve.

The field that caught my attention was machine learning, specially
deep learning, and now I am on my on-going journey to master these
subjects and keep up with the state of the art. I have a special
interest in computer vision applications.

I am 29 years old, live in Porto Alegre city in Brazil. I enjoy
riding my bike, spending time with friends and family and I am a
passionate practitioner of DeRose Method.
