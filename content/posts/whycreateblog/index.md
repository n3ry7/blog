When I told my girlfriend I wanted to start posting in my own blog
the first thing she said was: "Aren't blogs a thing from the past"?

Well I think it is a pretty good idea and in this very first post I
am gonna tell you why.

People do things for different reasons. But I think if you are an
aspiring data scientist or coder, it might be a good idea to starting
posting.

In my reading of "Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and Pytorch", by Jeremy Howard, 
creating a blog was a suggestion from the author.
And initially I thought: "Well that would be a lot of effort for
something that I am not really into". It turned out to be really easy
to create the blog using Hugo and I learned a lot of interesting
stuff in the process. 

## The goals of this blog

### Learn better

When I reflect upon the idea of the blog, it totally makes sense: the
best way to learning something is explaining it to someone else.

### Keep track of my progress

There are many other ways I could do this (and I do), but the blog is
useful because it also show my learning journey to other people,
which helps me promoting myself and share knowledge.

### Promote myself

As said in last item, having your learning process available to other
people can make other people notice you, so you might get to know
people and have access to opportunities you wouldn't otherwise.

### Share knowledge

Of course I am not the best teacher for these subjects I am gonna be
sharing here. But there is a very important aspect in this process,
as I write, I am in a similar position to the person that is trying
to learn, so I might have an approach that is very relatable to them.

### Connect with people

I have lots to talk about when the subject is something that
interests me. And it is not rare that friends and persons I live
together don't share the same passion for theses subjects. Here I can
~~talk~~ write as much as I would like and probably find other people
that share the same interest.

## What this blog is about

Mainly about deep learning.

But I will frequently share other things that I find interesting too.
You could expect to see stuff related to Vim, Linux, hardware and
tech.

Thanks for your time, hope to see you again here!
